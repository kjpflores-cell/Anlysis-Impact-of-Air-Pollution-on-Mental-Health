---

## üîç Overview  
This project investigates the relationship between **air pollution (NO‚ÇÇ levels)** and **mental health indicators, such as sleep quality and duration**, using data from **Barcelona**.  

The analysis was conducted in **two phases**:  
1. **Initial version in Google Sheets** for basic data cleaning and visualization  
2. **Enhanced analysis in R** for advanced statistical insights and improved visualizations  

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Analyze air pollution levels and their correlation with sleep duration  
- Compare mental health patterns in high vs. low NO‚ÇÇ concentration days  
- Explore how data visualization improves decision-making and storytelling  

---

## ‚úÖ Key Insights  
- Higher **NO‚ÇÇ levels** correlate with **shorter sleep duration**  
- Days with **elevated pollution** show a potential link to **lower mental well-being**  
- R-based analysis provided **clearer patterns** compared to the initial Google Sheets version

## üìÇ Project Structure  
- **/data**: Initial dataset (Impact_Air-Pollution_on_Mental-Health_AnalysisV1)  
- **analysis.R**: R script for cleaning and visualization  
- **visualizations/**: PNG charts created in R  
- **README.md**: Project documentation  

---

## üìä Analysis Phases  
### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Google Sheets**  
- Performed **data cleaning**, removed inconsistencies, handled missing values  
- Created **pivot tables and charts** for initial exploratory analysis  
- [Impact_Air-Pollution_on_Mental-Health_AnalysisV1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l04DSKw9kZwAJBKQGaKQeLCNJmh-RMRSU56GCbGP2Kw/edit?gid=506892392#gid=506892392)  

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì R Analysis**  
- Used **dplyr** for data wrangling  
- Created **scatter plots** and trend lines to examine correlations  
- Exported visualizations as `.png` for sharing  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions  
- **Challenge**: Data inconsistencies across sources  
- **Solution**: Standardized format in Google Sheets before loading into R

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
Air pollution (NO‚ÇÇ) appears to have a measurable impact on sleep duration, which can influence mental well-being. Further studies with larger datasets are recommended.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps  
- Expand analysis using **SQL** for advanced queries  
- Build a **Tableau dashboard** for interactive data storytelling  
- Integrate additional environmental and behavioral variables for deeper insights
